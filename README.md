# Web Wizards - Round 1

## Overview

Welcome to the Web Wizards event! In this round, you will be working on debugging and improving the provided web scripts. Your tasks include fixing syntax errors, improving code indentation, adding required comments, enhancing responsiveness, and implementing accessibility features.

### Files Provided

- `index.html` - The main HTML file for the event's webpage.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `sdgs.html` - A secondary HTML file listing the 12 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

1. **Open GitHub:**
   - Go to the repository page on GitHub.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Click the **Code** button and copy the URL provided (either HTTPS or SSH).
   - Open your terminal (or Git Bash) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied.

3. **Navigate to the Repository Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-name>` with the name of your cloned repository.

### 2. Fix the Issues

1. **Open Files in Your Code Editor:**
   - Use Visual Studio Code (or your preferred code editor) to open `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `sdgs.html`.

2. **Debugging and Fixing Errors:**
   - **Syntax Errors:** Look for and fix any syntax errors in the HTML and CSS files.
   - **Code Indentation:** Ensure all code is properly indented and organized.
   - **Comments:** Add comments to your code where necessary to explain your changes.
   - **Responsiveness:** Improve the responsiveness of the webpage by adjusting CSS styles.
   - **Accessibility:** Add accessibility features such as `alt` attributes for images and ensure good color contrast.

3. **Test Locally:**
   - Open `index.html` and `sdgs.html` in your web browser to test your changes locally and ensure everything looks and works as expected.

### 3. Commit and Push Your Changes

1. **Stage Your Changes:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   This command stages all modified files for commit.

2. **Commit Your Changes:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix syntax errors, improve responsiveness, and add accessibility features"
   ```

   Customize the commit message to describe the changes you made.

3. **Push Your Changes to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

   This command pushes your changes to the `main` branch of the repository.

### 4. Verify Your Changes

- Ensure your changes have been pushed to GitHub by visiting the repository page.
- If using GitHub Pages, check the live URL provided in the GitHub Pages section of the repository settings to see your updated webpage.

## Additional Notes

- If you encounter any issues or need help, refer to the GitHub documentation or reach out for assistance.
- Make sure to complete all tasks within the 40-minute time limit.

Good luck, and happy coding!
